## 🚀 Technical Highlights

### 🔍 Hashmap Implementation

To enhance the app's performance and explore the use of hashmaps, I've implemented them for managing and sorting various activities. Here’s how hashmaps are utilized in the app:

- **Activity Management**: Hashmaps store activities with associated metadata (name, emoji, description), allowing for efficient retrieval and management.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Activities are sorted by priority using hashmaps, ensuring users see the most relevant information first.
- **Interactive UI**: The app’s UI leverages hashmaps to provide quick data access and display, with interactive elements for a better user experience.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and building a fast, scalable web application.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve code quality with static type checking.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth, interactive animations and transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To create a responsive and modern design with utility-first CSS.
- **ShadCN**: For UI components and design consistency.
